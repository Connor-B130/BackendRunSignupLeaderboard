Imagine provides free, year-round grief support for children and families coping with loss due to death. In addition to providing grief support at its two centers in Mountainside and Newark, Imagine provides grief education and training to schools, agencies, and workplaces, and on-site support after any traumatic loss.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>One of the largest 5k\u2019s in the area, Greta\u2019s Run was founded in memory of Greta Schoenemann by her childhood friends Ben Nanna and Jayne Ruotolo. Greta was a Westfield High School freshman when she died from injuries sustained when a tree branch fell on her and her classmates during lunch. This year is the 11-year Anniversary of when the memorial race began.</p>\r\n<p>After the 5K race and Kids Fun Run, we will hold a Memory Walk and invite everyone in our community to participate. You can purchase a lawn sign in honor of a person in your life who has died. We will line the perimeter of this walk and the end of the run with the lawn signs of remembrance, sending a message that although our people have died, they are not forgotten \u2013 they are still with us. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>We hope that you will join us and walk alongside our families, our children, and our community, and let everyone know that their loss matters, that they are not alone, and they are never forgotten. \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Pick up your bib and shirt ahead of May 19 Feet Fleet in Westfield - available days and times will be announced closer to the race day. Fleet Feet is located at 123 Quimby St, Westfield, NJ 07090. Can&#39;t make it during those times? No worries! Shirts and bibs will also be available for pickup on the morning of the race.\u00a0</p>",

We founded our company on the principal of bringing families and friends together for fitness and food while giving back to our community. We are committed to supporting breast cancer research and organizations that help give support to breast cancer patients. Each year, we select 2-3 not for profits to be charity beneficiaries of our races.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Our beneficiary for this event is : Metavivor. A portion of our proceeds and all donations will go directly to Metavivor. We picked this charity because Metavivor is at the forefront of investing in research for metastatic breast cancer, as in breast cancer that has spread to bones, brain, or other vital organs. While those men and women that die from breast cancer almost always have metastatic disease, currently only 2-5% of funds raised for breast cancer research are allocated for Stage 4.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>In honor of my best friend Lynette the matriarchs of my family Mama Ceci, Mama Olga, Mama Chicho, and my aunt Delia and the dozens of other women who inspire to give to breast cancer charities.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

Songkran in Thai means &#34;to move&#34; or &#34;change place.&#34; Thai believe that water is purifying: it cleanses one of any bad luck from the past year, and blesses one with good fortune and happiness for the year ahead. On Songkran, people celebrate with water play.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">At Color Run 2024, runners and walkers will be splashed with colored powder at various points along the route in Brookdale Park.
