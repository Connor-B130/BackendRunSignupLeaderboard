As a former county prosecutor, leader, mentor, and teacher, Dee was a diligent civil leader to local law enforcement officers.</p>\r\n<p>Dee passed away unexpectedly in June 2021 and left behind a legacy of hard work along with his amazing family and countless friends. Dee was passionate about being active and loved biking, running, hiking, and any outdoor activity under the &#34;Blue Dome.&#34; He lived life to the fullest, by living &#34;his dash,&#34; and is greatly missed.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of the race is to honor Dee&#39;s memory and a make a thoughtful donation to support local programs important to Dee. \u00a0Last year, donations and race proceeds topped $22,000 and went to Weber State University for Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice scholarship programs. In addition, a new \u201cLive Your Dash\u201d Summer Reading Program is being developed to help struggling children with reading assistance.

            "description": "<h5><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1\">Come and celebrate your Octoberfest with us at Big Truck Farm Brewery in Parkton, MD. &#34;Truck&#34;tober Fest!</span></h5>\r\n<h5><br /><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1\">This is a 5k trail run. The course is a loop that will take you through the fields, woods, and hop yard of the farm. There is ALOT of elevation with this course and should be quite challenging, but boy does it offer some gorgeous views. The planned start of the race is 11:00 am with beer pouring starting at 12:00 pm. All runners, 21 and up will get 1 beer token, and all racers will receive a shirt.</span></h5>\r\n<h5><br /><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1\">After the finish of the 5k (should be around 12:30 pm), we will start running beer miles on premises as well. The Beer Mile will consist of a .25 mile out and back that you will run 4 times. Before the start of each lap you must consume one 12 ounce can of beer. The 4 beers are included in your registration fee and will be provided by Big Truck Farm Brewery. \u00a0This will be broken down into waves of 12 racers having 20 minutes to complete their beer mile. You will pick a wave start time during your registration starting at 12:40 pm with the last wave at 4:40 pm. Please note, if you sign up for both events, when you select your &#34;Wave Start Time&#34; this start time is only for your Beer Mile start time. The 5K start time is still 11:00 AM.</span></h5>\r\n<h5><br /><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1\">Beer Mile participants we highly encourage you bring a designated driver! An ID is required to participate in the event. No ID No alcohol. No outside alcohol is permitted on property.</span></h5>\r\n<h5><br /><span style=\"color:#ecf0f1\">There will be food trucks available post race to purchase food from as well as pours of beer and food available for purchase from Big Truck Farm Brewery. The Parkton location has a full bar with many of their beers on tap including some you may not find in store. (We will update you with the selection as we get closer)</span></h5>",

Men participating in Walk a Mile in her Shoes\u00ae will provide their own heels for the event. Women are encouraged to wear tennis shoes.</p>\r\n<p>This year&#39;s event is Saturday June 22, 2024, with registration beginning at 10 AM at the Echo [13th Street District].</p>\r\n<p>From the Walk a Mile in Her Shoes National Organization</p>\r\n<p>Each year, an ever-increasing number of men, women and their families are joining the award-winning Walk a Mile in Her Shoes\u00ae: The International Men&#39;s March to Stop Rape, Sexual Assault &amp; Gender Violence. A Walk a Mile in Her Shoes\u00ae Event is a playful opportunity for men to raise awareness in their community about the serious causes, effects and remediations to sexualized violence. First You Walk the Walk: There is an old saying: &#34;You can&#39;t really understand another person&#39;s experience until you&#39;ve walked a mile in their shoes.&#34; Walk a Mile in Her Shoes\u00ae asks men to literally walk one mile in women&#39;s high-heeled shoes. It&#39;s not easy walking in these shoes, but it&#39;s fun and it gets the community to talk about something that&#39;s really difficult to talk about: gender relations and sexual violence.</p>\r\n<p>Website to WAM: http://www.walkamileinhershoes.org/</p>",

The race again will be again at Winding Waters Natural Area which will give you the experience of one of the most authentic and gorgeous trail races in Palm Beach County! You\u2019ll be amazed you\u2019re a few short miles from the hustle and bustle of West Palm Beach!</p>\r\n<p>The 5K course is a loop around the wetlands trail with a short trip through a wooded double-track fire road. It\u2019s a beautiful course offering a huge variety of surfaces and scenery!</p>\r\n<p>The Race for the Natural Areas aims to showcase the Palm Beach County Natural Areas. Winding Waters is an over 500-acre natural area containing a diversity of habitats, such as mesic flatwoods, hydric hammock, depression marsh, wet prairie, and dome swamp. Several areas were cleared for agricultural purposes and have been restored to shallow-water and deep-water marshes.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The course itself will be a trail ringing the restored wetland offering scenic views of the teeming plant and animal life.</p>\r\n<p>We have a capacity of 300 this year, so it remains a somewhat exclusive event and we expect it to sellout, once again!</p>\r\n<p><b>Course Description</b><br />The 5K loop is a mix of shallow sand, grassy areas, and firm flatwoods. Despite being a challenging course, it flows fast! The sandy areas are shallow with only a couple patches of deeper, softer sand that you can get around very easily. There are no hills or water crossings.</p>\r\n<p><b>Water/Restrooms</b><br />There will be two water stations along the route and there will be portable restrooms near the packet pickup table.</p>\r\n<p><b>Timing</b><br />This will not be a timed race, this is a fun run to enjoy the wild &amp; scenic Winding Waters Natural Area.</p>\r\n<p><b>Awards/Medal</b><br />We will have trophies for Female &amp; Male 1st - 3rd place.</p>\r\n<p><b>Shirts</b><br />No shirts this year...it&#39;s free.</p>\r\n<p><b>Race Day Schedule</b><br />2:00 pm: Natural Areas Festival starts<br />2:00 pm - 4:00 pm: Packet pickup<br />4:00 pm: 5K start<br />4:45 pm: Awards</p>",
