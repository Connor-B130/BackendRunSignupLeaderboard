Since then, the Shelter has developed and grown onto a long-term residential treatment facility. In April 2002, a new 7,000 square-foot facility was built on a two-acre lot at South 26th and Quincy. The shelter is licensed for eight girls, ages 12 – 17 years old. During the Summer, our girls will volunteer for one of our sponsors United Way and their agencies. </p>\r\n<p>The Girls Shelter strives to develop its residents into responsible citizens and community members. The girls are:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Taught social and independent living skills.</li><li>Given a sense of self-worth and taught to be responsible for their actions and decisions.</li><li>Taught job skills and money management by working summer jobs.</li><li>Required to attend and take an active part in school.</li><li>Given individual treatment plans including structured goals and objectives.</li><li>Provided counseling.</li><li>The long-term goal of the Girls Shelter is to reunite the resident with her family.</li></ul>\r\n<h3><u>OUR MISSION</u></h3>\r\n<p>Our mission is to provide a safe and encouraging atmosphere in a residential setting for at risk females aged 12 – 17 years; to promote positive behaviors, character enhancement, educational advancement, and to reunite with family.</p>\r\n<p>Many of our residents have had a less than desirable childhood. Common histories include physical and sexual abuse,<br />parents with drug issues, parents in prison and homelessness.</p>\r\n<p>We teach personal responsibility, independent living skills and positive social skills. We provide case management,<br />individual and family counseling.</p>\r\n<p>We provide a safe home environment, all food, transportation, personal items, and clothing. They receive individual and family counseling.</p>\r\n<p>As one Board member put it, “we have one year to pour all the good into them we can possibly give them”.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

                "description": "<p>Walk a Mile in Her Shoes® Marshalltown is a united gender movement where men will be a part of the solution to ending sexualized violence.</p>\r\n<p>The mission of Walk a Mile in Her Shoes® is to co-create a united gender movement where men will be a part of the solution to ending sexualized violence by marching a mile in heeled shoes. Men participating in Walk a Mile in her Shoes® will provide their own heels for the event. Women are encouraged to wear tennis shoes.</p>\r\n<p>This year&#39;s event is Saturday June 22, 2024, with registration beginning at 10 AM at the Echo [13th Street District].</p>\r\n<p>From the Walk a Mile in Her Shoes National Organization</p>\r\n<p>Each year, an ever-increasing number of men, women and their families are joining the award-winning Walk a Mile in Her Shoes®: The International Men&#39;s March to Stop Rape, Sexual Assault &amp; Gender Violence. A Walk a Mile in Her Shoes® Event is a playful opportunity for men to raise awareness in their community about the serious causes, effects and remediations to sexualized violence. First You Walk the Walk: There is an old saying: &#34;You can&#39;t really understand another person&#39;s experience until you&#39;ve walked a mile in their shoes.&#34; Walk a Mile in Her Shoes® asks men to literally walk one mile in women&#39;s high-heeled shoes. It&#39;s not easy walking in these shoes, but it&#39;s fun and it gets the community to talk about something that&#39;s really difficult to talk about: gender relations and sexual violence.</p>\r\n<p>Website to WAM: http://www.walkamileinhershoes.org/</p>",

Unlike other areas, Union County has a nice network of trails and plans to expand them, so we would like to encourage people to get out and move no matter the weather or time of year!</p>\r\n<p><br />Your call to action for the Stay Active Year Round campaign for the spring is to participate in the #StayActive 5k. The race starts at Mill Creek Park (by the soccer fields) and runs up the Jim Simmons Trail into Mill Valley North and then back over the pedestrian bridge. All proceeds benefit the Union County Health Department and allow us to provide mini-grants to local schools to encourage youth to learn life long health habits like running and walking!</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Packet Pickup:<br /></strong></span>March 15, 2024<br />10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.<br />Union County Health Department <br />940 London Ave #1100, Marysville, OH 43040</h4>",

The race again will be again at Winding Waters Natural Area which will give you the experience of one of the most authentic and gorgeous trail races in Palm Beach County! You’ll be amazed you’re a few short miles from the hustle and bustle of West Palm Beach!</p>\r\n<p>The 5K course is a loop around the wetlands trail with a short trip through a wooded double-track fire road. It’s a beautiful course offering a huge variety of surfaces and scenery!</p>\r\n<p>The Race for the Natural Areas aims to showcase the Palm Beach County Natural Areas. Winding Waters is an over 500-acre natural area containing a diversity of habitats, such as mesic flatwoods, hydric hammock, depression marsh, wet prairie, and dome swamp. Several areas were cleared for agricultural purposes and have been restored to shallow-water and deep-water marshes. </p>\r\n<p>The course itself will be a trail ringing the restored wetland offering scenic views of the teeming plant and animal life.</p>\r\n<p>We have a capacity of 300 this year, so it remains a somewhat exclusive event and we expect it to sellout, once again!</p>\r\n<p><b>Course Description</b><br />The 5K loop is a mix of shallow sand, grassy areas, and firm flatwoods. Despite being a challenging course, it flows fast! The sandy areas are shallow with only a couple patches of deeper, softer sand that you can get around very easily. There are no hills or water crossings.</p>\r\n<p><b>Water/Restrooms</b><br />There will be two water stations along the route and there will be portable restrooms near the packet pickup table.</p>\r\n<p><b>Timing</b><br />This will not be a timed race, this is a fun run to enjoy the wild &amp; scenic Winding Waters Natural Area.</p>\r\n<p><b>Awards/Medal</b><br />We will have trophies for Female &amp; Male 1st - 3rd place.</p>\r\n<p><b>Shirts</b><br />No shirts this year...it&#39;s free.</p>\r\n<p><b>Race Day Schedule</b><br />2:00 pm: Natural Areas Festival starts<br />2:00 pm - 4:00 pm: Packet pickup<br />4:00 pm: 5K start<br />4:45 pm: Awards</p>",

The 10K race begins at 10,000 ft at the summit of Rabbit Ears Pass. The course begins by heading uphill on USFS dirt roads and 2 track, and then then heads downhill on single-track, ending on a cross country single-track. The total elevation gain and loss are about ~1,200 feet each.</p>\r\n<p>*Although this race is listed as a 10k, the actual distance comes out to 6.8 miles. We will have one aid station on the course about 3.4 miles in (the 5k race option does not have an aid station). We HIGHLY recommend that you bring your own water.</p>",
